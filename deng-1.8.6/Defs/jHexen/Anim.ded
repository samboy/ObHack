# jHexen: Additional Animation Sequences
#
# Hexen uses the ANIMDEFS lump to define texture animation sequences.
# In order to remain compatible with existing WADs, jHexen reads 
# ANIMDEFS and creates texture animation groups for the sequences in it.
# The flags "tgf_smooth" and "tgf_first_only" are set for each group.
#
# Additional sequences can be defined using Group definitions.
