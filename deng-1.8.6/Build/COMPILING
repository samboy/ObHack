COMPILING DOOMSDAY AND THE LIBRARIES
====================================

This document describes the recommended way for building Doomsday and
the libraries on a *nix system (i.e. only Linux at the moment).

If you want generic instructions on compiling see the INSTALL file in
the base of the Doomsday source tree.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

You will need these tools and libraries for building everything:

- gcc (obviously)
- GNU automake 1.7 (or newer)
- GNU Autoconf
- libtool (I'm using 1.5.6, earlier versions probably work)
- libltdl
- GNU Make
- ncurses
- OpenGL (use "--without-opengl" when configuring to disable)
- GLU
- Simple Directmedia Layer (http://www.libsdl.org/)
- SDL_net
- SDL_mixer (used for sound by default)
- OpenAL (alternative sound library, provides 3D sound)


IF YOU HAVE A SOURCE TARBALL:
-----------------------------

1. Unpack the source tarball, if you haven't already done so.

2. Cd to the Build directory.  Compiling under the Build directory
   will keep the main source directories clean of any object files.
   It also prevents conflicts in the Src/Common/ directory, which is
   used in a slightly different way by each game.

3. Run "../configure".  By default, everything will be installed under
   /usr/local.  You might want to use e.g. "--prefix=/home/user/deng".

4. If configure failed due to missing libraries, install the required
   ones.  Make sure you have the development files for each.

5. Run "make" and then "su -c 'make install'".  (If you are installing
   into your home directory, just run "make install".)  This will
   compile everything and install the executable (doomsday), the
   libraries (games, renderer, sound), data files and definitions
   files under the directory specified by the configured prefix.

6. See the main README for tips on running the game.


IF YOU USE CVS:
---------------

1. Check out a copy of the project files from the SourceForge CVS.
   You will only need the "doomsday" module.  You can find
   instructions on how to accomplish this here:

      http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=74815

2. Run "./autogen.sh".

3. Proceed to compiling as with a source tarball (from step 3).
