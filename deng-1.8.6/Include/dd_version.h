 * Version number rules: (major).(minor).(revision)-(release)
 *
 * Major version will be 1 for now (few things short of a complete 
 * rewrite will increase the major version).
 *
 * Minor version increases with important feature releases.
 * NOTE: No extra zeros. Numbering goes from 1 to 9 and continues from
 * 10 like 'normal' numbers.
 *
 * Revision number increases with each small (maintenance) release.
