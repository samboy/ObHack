Enhanced version of Heretic 1.3, the classic Doom-based first person
shooter by Raven Software.

jHeretic and the Doomsday Engine are based on the source code of
various games released by id Software and Raven Software. For license
information see RavenLic.txt.

ABOUT THIS VERSION

As always I'd appreciate hearing how this version works for you. If
you encounter any bugs, please send me an email with the contents of
Doomsday.out included. When an error message is shown and the game
exits to Windows, Notepad opens up automatically showing Doomsday.out.
However, that does NOT happen if the game actually *crashes*, in which
case you'll have to go and find the Doomsday.out yourself. It can be
found in the game's runtime folder.

To play, run Kicks.exe.

NOTE:   If you get error messages about missing DLLs or OCXs, please
        download the necessary Visual Basic support files from
        http://www.doomsdayhq.com/. Doomsday KickStart is a VB
        application and thus requires a couple of support libraries.

If you have insurmountable problems using KickStart and would like to
have a launcher with a GUI, get the Doomsday Utilities (ddutils.exe)
and launch with DLaunch.

TIPS

* Type "help" in the console. "listcmds" and "listvars" will show you
  a list of the console commands and variables, respectively.

* Load external WADs and lump files using the console, see the
  commands "load", "unload" and "reset". Place the files in the
  runtime folder so you access them without specifying a path.

* Screenshots can be taken with the console command "screenshot". You
  could for example bind it to F12: "bind f12 screenshot". Another way
  is to use the -ravpic option: with it you can take screenshots with
  F1, no bindings necessary.

* You can bind several keys or buttons to the same control/action in
  the Controls menu. Rebind a key or button to remove a binding.
  Nothing can be bound to the Esc key, which is used for menu
  activation.

* See the documentation in the Doc\ folder for more information.
