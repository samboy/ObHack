                        ==========================
               Legend: + added, - fixed, * improved/changed


Version 1.8.6
-------------
+ "Flats" external resource category: defaults to "Data/Game/Flats/"
* external flats are searched first from "Data/Game/Flats/"
* PK3s can now be compressed (normal ZIP files)
* unlimited nesting of autoloads via Auto directory and virtual files
+ PK3 path mapping: files in the root of a PK3 mapped to the Auto
  directories (see Readme for details)
+ lump assembly prefixes (see Readme for details)
+ Reflection -> Min color: minimum RGB color for the reflection (to
  make the reflection visible even without regular sector light)
- fixed: model file hash reset properly when running 'reset'
- fixed: problem with multiple -file options

SDL_mixer:
* MUS data converted to MIDI is stored in the runtime directory instead
  of /tmp

Mac OS X:
+ MiniStart launcher
* music is played using QuickTime (MIDI problems resolved)
- multiple endianness issues fixed in texture/PK3/model handling


Version 1.8.5
-------------
+ surface reflections (shiny effects)
+ 'Reflection' definition
+ cvar 'rend-tex-shiny': enable surface reflections
+ Model -> Sub -> Shiny reaction: how much shiny textures react to angle
  changes
+ cvar 'rend-model-shiny-strength': shininess factor for all models (0..1)
+ Model -> Sub -> Blending mode: select a blending mode (bm_* flag)
+ bm_* flags in Flags.ded (blending modes)
+ cvars 'conopen', 'conclose', 'contoggle': open/close console prompt
* detail textures can now use external resources instead of WAD lumps
  (Detail -> File)
* external resources can be located in relation to Doomsday base path
  (e.g. Shiny map = "Data/LightMaps/Shine")
- fixed: dynamic light clipping in the case where lights are in the same
  subsector with a polyobj

jHexen:
+ cvar 'hud-scale': scaling factor for HUD graphics and messages

Win32:
+ option '-nostwin': don't show the startup message dialog (quicker 
  startup)
* crashes are handled more gracefully
- fixed: vcbuild.bat didn't include resources in Doomsday.exe and 
  drD3D.dll, which meant that the startup window and the drD3D config 
  dialog were missing


Version 1.8.4
-------------
* shiny texture coordinates are calculated using a simplified algorithm
- fixed: shiny texture coordinate 'warparound' artifact
- fixed: FakeRadio hanged in maps with some unusual map geometry

Win32:
+ vcbuild.bat: builds everything from the command line
* built using Visual C++ Toolkit 2003, available from:
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/

- keycode handling in console/UI didn't always use the keymap

jDoom:
- fixed: crushed barrels now explode correctly and don't become gibs

  (DENG_MIDI_CMD can be used to specify an external player)
* fixed-point math using inline assembler like in Windows (courtesy of
  Lukasz Stelmach)

Mac OS X:
* a native build that runs on Mac OS X 10.3 
* now compiles with Xcode
- fixed various glitches with regards to loading of plugins


Version 1.8.2
-------------

- cvar 'rend-camera-smooth' was hidden
- fixed: game event smoothing now operates seamlessly regardless of the
  framerate
- fixed: camera position smoothing wasn't synced correctly to frames
- fixed: segfault related to sight checking over large distances (e.g.
  TNT map 27)
+ dpMapLoad: glBSP 1.96 as a plugin, run on the fly when necessary
+ rend-halo-realistic: use only more realistic halos (slightly smaller,
  dimmer), no secondary lens flares; enabled by default
- fixed: Map Info -> Execute
- fixed: FakeRadio bug where vertical shadows were rendered above and
  under the left and right edge of an opening in a straight wall
- GL must not be loaded at all in dedicated mode
- file finder had problems descending into subdirectories

  game and in the UI
- mouse filter is more careful not to ever lose any mickeys
- all pending ticcmds are always processed immediately (excessive
  buffering no longer a danger)
- fixed several endianness issues to allow building on a big endian arch
* tuned up handling of ticcmds during transfer from client to server
* particle movement is smoothed (except flat particles that contact 
  a surface)
* mouse look is always as smooth as it can be
* all games use the same keyboard look scheme (jDoom's was different)
* framerate is measured more accurately
+ ccmd 'message': display a local game message

Common:
* more unified handling of ticcmds
+ cvar 'player-move-speed': player movement speed modifier (0..1)

jDoom:
- fixed: '-warp' made fonts disappear

jHeretic/jHexen:
- fixed: when a demo stops continue with a running InFine sequence

Win32:
- too many console messages caused a crash during startup (extra verbosity)

+ cvar 'rend-light-wall-angle': intensity of angle-based wall lighting
+ cvar 'input-mouse-filter': average mouse X/Y axis values
+ model flag 'df_dim' (0x1000000): model is never rendered fullbright
+ cmds 'movefloor', 'moveceil', 'movesec': move a sector's plane(s)
* low-level networking updated to DirectX 8
* improved network setup GUI
* client can only connect to servers in the same game mode
* cmd 'net' prints usage info
* cvar 'net-ip-port' is the local TCP/IP port
* "Filter mouse movement" added to Control Panel's Input page
* -nohightex now only affects wall textures and flats
* crosshair color alpha (cmd "crosshair color", var "view-cross-a")
- fixed: client was able to connect to a server running a different game
- fixed: aborted client connection crashed the server
- potential problem handling client connections fixed
- fixed: fullbrightness didn't affect particles
- DirectSound 8: fixed a problem with buffer loading; using -csd should 
  no longer be necessary
- Sound definition patching fixed (Ext/Group keys were ignored)
- fixed bug 712332: when server pauses a netgame, all clients will pause

KickStart:
* Cheb's KickStart v2.09 replaces the ancient v1.6

jDoom:
+ game modes: doom1-share, doom1, doom1-ultimate, doom2, doom2-plut, 
  doom2-tnt
+ automap added to Options -> Controls (under Misc.)
+ cvar game-corpse-sliding: corpses slide down stairs and ledges 
  (defaults to zero due to some bad behaviour; e.g. exit room of D2/22)
* cvar game-corpsetime renamed to game-corpse-time
- fixed bug 734892: sides with bogus sectors
- A_Tracer() used to spawn puffs that were identical to bullet puffs, 
  this caused complications with particle generators

jHeretic:
+ game modes: heretic-share, heretic (normal registered), heretic-ext 
  (has episodes 4, 5)

jHexen:
+ game modes: hexen, hexen-dk (Death Kings of Dark Citadel)
- fixed: sound sequence delays with repeating sounds (sequence updater
  didn't get correct information about currently playing sound effects)
  
drOpenGL/drD3D:
+ -refresh option
* closest available refresh rate selected


Version 1.7.8
-------------
+ new master server mechanism (uses HTTP)
+ cvar net-master-path (default: "/master.php"): location of the master
  server at 'net-master-address' (default: "www.doomsdayhq.com")
+ cmd "net announce": send a server announcement to the master (if 
  server-public is nonzero, announcements are made automatically at two
  minute intervals)
* cvar net-master-port (default: 0): usually zero or 80
* clientside player coords override serverside coords under normal
  circumstances (maxdif checks removed)
* if one part of a psprite is fullbright, the whole psprite will be
- fixed: psprites were rendered with depth testing enabled; Doom plasma 
  rifle fire anim was broken
- fixed: clientside player animation didn't finish anim sequence
- fixed: line flags weren't updated on clientside (e.g. in Hexen map13)
- fixed: minor edge artifact with multipart psprites (e.g. in jDoom)

jDoom:
* lineattack weapons hit planes (pistol, shotguns, chaingun) 
- fixed: lineattack check for hitting sky planes, skyhack walls
- map31 and map32 no longer assumed to exist: Doom2.wad "00f6d407" 
  should work 
- weapon psprite timings (in Objects.ded) adjusted for super shotgun,
  rocket launcher: muzzle flash was out-of-sync by 1-2 tics

jHexen:
- fixed: dedicated server tried to draw teleport gfx and crashed
- fixed: scripted + yellow messages not shown on clientside
- fixed: client crashes when changing level
- fixed: status bar flicker

jtNet2:
- old master server stuff removed


Version 1.7.7
-------------
+ switch texture pairs (SW1/SW2) are precached at the same time
+ "Generator:Stage:Radius rnd": Randomness of particle radius
+ sound-info shows sound names as well as ID numbers
+ support for textured particles
* flat particles stick to planes
- high-resolution flats with 4 channels (alpha) were loaded incorrectly
- sector lightlevel overflow in sectordelta (e.g. on jHexen map 26)
- alternative texture path must be tried first when loading hires images
  (-texdir2)

jDoom:
* cvar player-air-movement: player movement speed while airborne 
  (0-32); use only small values in netgames
  
jHeretic:
- blinking statbar borders fixed
