# My fork of FreeDoom

This is my personal fork of [FreeDoom](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Freedoom)
which I have been maintaining since 2008.  The purpose of this fork is
to make a version of FreeDoom which takes as little space as possible,
while giving me a compelling gaming experience.

The name of this fork is `ObHack FreeDoom`, and it is designed to be
used with [ObHack](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ObHack).

# Design goals

* Small size
* Optimized to run well in [Doomsday](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doomsday) 1.8.6
* Compatible with [Chocolate Doom](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Chocolate_Doom) and other [source ports](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Source_port).

Here is how I achieve these goals

## Small size

I have, with four exceptions, replaced all of the levels with tiny
“instant exit” placeholder levels.  This minimizes the amount of
space the [wad](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/WAD) takes; people who wish 
more levels can use ObHack to generate a 32-map megawad.  The four 
levels are:

* MAP01, an older version of FreeDoom’s MAP01
* MAP02, which is FreeDoom’s MAP02
* MAP12, an ObHack generated map
* MAP30, a deathmatch map from this [discussion thread](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/90524-rework-in-freedm-maps/?page=5&tab=comments#comment-1925820);  I got permission from the author to release this map with FreeDoom’s license.

All of the other levels are copies of the same placeholder level, giving
this megawad all of five unique levels.

The reason why we have the one randomly generated map is so the built 
in [demo](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Demo) works; this allows the
“Official” ObHack-generated 32-level [PWAD](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/PWAD)
to be loaded and still have the demo work.

## Optimized for Doomsday 1.8.6

This megawad is designed to run well in Doomsday 1.8.6.  FreeDoom 0.7
is the last version of FreeDoom which does not crash in Doomsday 1.8.6;
this megawad, as a result, is a fork of FreeDoom 0.7 with some updates
from newer versions of FreeDoom:  Some of the improved monster sprites
and some of the newer music.  I have also updated the title screen,
to make it clear this is *not* in any way an official FreeDoom release.

The reason why we use Doomsday 1.8.6 instead of a newer release is
because this version runs better on older chipsets; the goal is
to have something which runs at a decent framerate on a 2010 era
Intel Atom Netbook (with, say, a N455 processor).  While I have
not dusted off my old netbook to see how well it runs, Doomsday
1.8.6 has given me good results back when a netbook was my main 
computer.

## The included music

Since there was a bug in FreeDoom 0.7 where a lot of the music had long
silent pauses (lasting well over a minute at times), I have updated
the music, either editing the song to no longer have a lot of silence
(MAP09 now has a drum solo, and MAP21 now has a drum and bass solo),
replacing the music with newer music from FreeDoom (done in MAP08,
MAP15 — while MAP15 has no issues with silence, I much prefer the more
upbeat newer FreeDoom theme, MAP22, MAP25, and MAP28), or using music
from another level (MAP26 now uses the same theme as MAP06).

With Doomsday 1.8.6, it’s better to use a [MUS](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MUS) 
file instead of a MIDI file whenever possible; the only MIDI files in
the megawad are ones with both have no issues playing back in Doomsday
1.8.6 and which do not cleanly convert to MUS format (MAP09, MAP11,
MAP14, MAP20, MAP21, and MAP23).

Since Doomsday uses Microsoft Windows’s native MIDI synth (a GS
emulation wavetable synth licensed from Roland, buried very deeply in
Windows in the file `gm.dls`), this is the expected playback device for
MIDI files.  The music files can also sound very good using an open
source stack, such as [Fluid Synth](http://www.fluidsynth.org/) with 
either
[Tim’s 6 megabyte full sound font](http://www.timbrechbill.com/saxguru/Timidity.php) 
or
[Frank Wen’s Fluid sound font](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=fluid-soundfont-gm).

## Chocolate Doom compatibility

This `DOOM2.WAD` file is compatible with Chocolate Doom, and should work
with any other Doom source port from this century.  Note that while the
music plays with Chocolate Doom’s default FM synth, the included music
files are not optimized for this synth.  To have good music, open up the
Chocolate-doom-setup program, go to “configure sound”, and use either
`GUS` or `Native MIDI` as the music playback device.

The reason why `DOOM2.WAD` includes a very short demo is so this wad does
not crash in Chocolate Doom.

Note that, while none of the maps included in `DOOM2.WAD` have issues in
Chocolate Doom, the maps generated by ObHack using the default settings
do have issues (e.g. the `MAP01` made when using ObHack’s default seed
and settings has a very prominent Hall of Mirrors issue).  If using
ObHack with Chocolate Doom, it is best to play tiny indoors maps.

Another thing: The wall poster in MAP12 of a burning fire has significant
moiré issues in Chocolate Doom and other source ports which do not use
graphics acceleration.  The solution to this problem is to play the game
in Doomsday 1.8.6 or another source port with accelerated graphics.

## Designed for ObHack

This wad, while a very short playable Doom2-like game, is designed to
be played with ObHack-generated wads.  ObHack is set up to, by default,
make a particular megawad which I consider to be the “canonical” default
megawad for this FreeDoom fork.  

By using procedural generation, we can have a large megawad using much
less space than a traditional hand-drawn megawad.
