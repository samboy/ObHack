3.3.4:  Fix issue with MAP09 silence by adding drum solo

3.3.3:  MAP28 had same issue with music as MAP03; fixed.

3.3.2:  Update DOOM2.WAD to fix two bugs:
          * Sprite ELECA rotated, which looked quite ugly
          * MAP08 music (D_DDTBLU) had long silence; replaced
        In both cases, I updated the files with assets from FreeDoom 0.12.1

3.3.1:  Added “credits” screen (doesn’t have credits, but is here so 
        Doomsday doesn’t show a white screen any more) and made demos 
	work with megawad.

3.3.0:  Updated deathmatch maps to reduce flicker problems, and to give
        all players the "starting weapon" if chosen when making a map.
        Updated title screen; remove randomly generated MAP13 and MAP14.
        Now the only randomly generated map is MAP12 (and, the only
        non-placeholder maps are MAP01, MAP02, MAP12, and MAP30).

3.2.2:  Bugfix: Always place deathmatch goodies in the same places, even 
        when making a second (or later) megawad during a given ObHack 
        session.

3.2.1:  Bugfix: Sometimes, a megawad would fail to build.  Fixed.

3.2.0:  Bugfix update: MAP27 had an issue with an ugly wall in the middle of 
        the outdoors.  We now check for that bug and rebuild a map which has
        it (only MAP27 with the seed "1FreeDoom1" is affected).  I also 
        fixed a bug where a prefab did not have a minimum height, resulting
        in monsters going through the ceiling, affecting MAP28.  Only MAP27 
        and MAP28 are affected when played in single player mode; MAP29 and 
        MAP30 are slightly different, but only in deathmatch mode (if even
        that).

3.1.0:	Updated ObHack to have more firepower in deathmatch mode when making
	“single player” maps.  The maps are completely unchanged in single
	player mode.  Added new “Carnage” mode; removed broken support for
	Capture the Flag (CTF) maps.  Removed support for untested games;
	the only supported games in this version are Doom 2 and FreeDoom.
	Updated MAP12, MAP13, and MAP14 in DOOM2.WAD to have this improved
	deathmatch experience (single player, again, is completely the 
	same).

3.0.0:  Updated ObHack and map builder to be (mostly) deterministic:  If 
        one runs ObHack twice with the same parameters, and either the seeds
	"1FreeDoom1" or "2FreeDoom1", one will get the same maps
	generated.  This means we no longer use the old 2009 map designs 
	at all; we instead make new maps.  Note that not every map will be
	exactly the same, but it would take too much time to make this code
	100% deterministic.

2.0.0:  Update map builder to be consistent, while preserving legacy level
        designs.  This changes how the maps look (albeit with the same
        overall design), so DOOM2.WAD updated.

1.0.0:  Level 1 of Doom2 wads now always has backpack and super shotgun

0.7:	ObHack-FreeDoom updated to use FreeDoom 0.7

0.7.1:	Updated title screen, zombieman, and shotgun guy graphics

0.7.2:	Updated SMITA0 (tree with foliage) to use Sergeant_Mark_IV's version

0.7.3:	Updated music

0.7.4:  Updated Imp (TROO*) and episode 2 city sky (RSKY2); reduced unique
        map count to nine to save compressed space.

0.7.5:  

* Waterfall texture in fountains fixed to use ObHack texture
* ObHack markers now use pictures I took of a fire last year
* Verified that the Imp is latest version of Raymoohawk's serpentide
* Update MAP12 music (D_THEDA2) to use scragadelic/reflection_scrag.mid
  (DM10 music in FreeDoom)

0.7.6 (2018-08-28):

* Update MAP12 music to use old 2009 D_THEDA2 soundtrack.

0.7.7 (2018-09-19):

* We now only have three random maps in the megawad, use three FreeDoom
  maps, and have Watermark.wad to make the Watermarks less obnoxious.

0.7.8 (2018-09-23):

* Map03 crashes in Deng 1.8.6 at UltraViolence difficulty.  This in mind,
  I have removed this map; also all maps except Map01, Map02, Map12, Map13,
  and Map14 are instant-exit dummy maps.

0.7.9 (2018-10-09):

* Made map30 a deathmatch map with monsters, as per the discussion at
  https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/90524-rework-in-freedm-maps/
