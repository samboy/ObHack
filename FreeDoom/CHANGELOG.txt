3.1.0:	Updated ObHack to have more firepower in deathmatch mode when making
	“single player” maps.  The maps are completely unchanged in single
	player mode.  Added new “Carnage” mode; removed broken support for
	Capture the Flag (CTF) maps.  Removed support for untested games;
	the only supported games in this version are Doom 2 and FreeDoom.
	Updated MAP12, MAP13, and MAP14 in DOOM2.WAD to have this improved
	deathmatch experience (single player, again, is completely the 
	same).

3.0.0:  Updated ObHack and map builder to be (mostly) deterministic:  If 
        one runs ObHack twice with the same parameters, and either the seeds
	"1FreeDoom1" or "2FreeDoom1", one will get the same maps
	generated.  This means we no longer use the old 2009 map designs 
	at all; we instead make new maps.  Note that not every map will be
	exactly the same, but it would take too much time to make this code
	100% deterministic.

2.0.0:  Update map builder to be consistent, while preserving legacy level
        designs.  This changes how the maps look (albeit with the same
        overall design), so DOOM2.WAD updated.

1.0.0:  Level 1 of Doom2 wads now always has backpack and super shotgun

0.7:	ObHack-FreeDoom updated to use FreeDoom 0.7

0.7.1:	Updated title screen, zombieman, and shotgun guy graphics

0.7.2:	Updated SMITA0 (tree with foliage) to use Sergeant_Mark_IV's version

0.7.3:	Updated music

0.7.4:  Updated Imp (TROO*) and episode 2 city sky (RSKY2); reduced unique
        map count to nine to save compressed space.

0.7.5:  

* Waterfall texture in fountains fixed to use ObHack texture
* ObHack markers now use pictures I took of a fire last year
* Verified that the Imp is latest version of Raymoohawk's serpentide
* Update MAP12 music (D_THEDA2) to use scragadelic/reflection_scrag.mid
  (DM10 music in FreeDoom)

0.7.6 (2018-08-28):

* Update MAP12 music to use old 2009 D_THEDA2 soundtrack.

0.7.7 (2018-09-19):

* We now only have three random maps in the megawad, use three FreeDoom
  maps, and have Watermark.wad to make the Watermarks less obnoxious.

0.7.8 (2018-09-23):

* Map03 crashes in Deng 1.8.6 at UltraViolence difficulty.  This in mind,
  I have removed this map; also all maps except Map01, Map02, Map12, Map13,
  and Map14 are instant-exit dummy maps.

0.7.9 (2018-10-09):

* Made map30 a deathmatch map with monsters, as per the discussion at
  https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/90524-rework-in-freedm-maps/
