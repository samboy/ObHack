
Quests Structure
================

A "quest" is a series of connected rooms where the final
room contains the goal of the quest, such as a key or
weapon.

There are two basic types: "main" quests and "sub" quests.
Main quests form the main structure of the level, containing
all the things you _must_ do (e.g. when playing the level
without any monsters).  Examples include: getting a key,
pressing a switch (to open a door or lower bars), or even
killing a boss monster which causes a pathway to open up
(such as the Bruiser Brothers in E1M8 of DOOM).

Sub quests are for weapons, powerups or even just a room
full of health and ammo.  Secrets are always sub quests
because you never need to find a secret to finish a level.
Sub quests can be said to "extend" the existing quest,
making the parent quest larger, as well as providing
a sub-goal.

The very last quest is called an "end" quest (though
technically it has the same status as a main quest).
End quests usually lead to a room with an exit switch
or an exit elevator (for Wolf3d).


Example
-------

The essential structure of a level might be:

     start
       |
       V
  1. main quest (red key)
  2. main quest (press blue switch)
  3. main quest (yellow key)
  4. end quest


Then add in some sub quests:

  1. main quest (red key)
     1.1 sub quest (super shotgun)
     1.2 sub quest (rocket launcher)
     1.3 sub quest (chainsaw)

  2. main quest (press blue switch)
     2.1 sub quest (invisibility sphere)

  3. main quest (yellow key)
     3.1 sub quest (backpack full of ammo)
     3.2 sub quest (plasma rifle)

  4. end quest


The level is built up by joining a quest (B say) onto an
existing quest (A say).  Unless the quests have the same
status (such as being SUB quests with the same parent),
then the join requires a locked door.

The rule for what kind of door is simple: assuming B is a
main quest, then the lock for the door is the one picked up
(or switched) on the main quest IMMEDIATELY BEFORE quest B.
Sub quests normally connect to their parent quest and hence
don't need any lock.

To refer to the example above: Quest 2 needs a red-keyed
door where it joins onto quest 1.  Quest 3 needs a blue
switched door where it joins onto quest 2 (or 1), and
Quest 4 needs a yellow-keyed door where it joins onto
quest 3 (or 2 or 1).


Hexen Details
-------------

Hexen is more complicated because of the hub system
which allows the player to travel back-n-forth between
different maps.

Oblige creates each episode using six maps:
  1 = starting map
  2 = map containing key A
  3 = map containing key B
  4 = weapon pieces map
  5 = secret map
  6 = boss (end) map

Key A is required to get to the boss level, and Key B is
required to get to the level containing the three pieces
of the super weapon.

For Hexen maps there are some additional types of quests.
The "gate" quest leads to a teleporter to a different map,
and a "back" quest leads to the teleporter that comes back.

Gate quests are usually sub quests, because when the
player comes back nothing has been unlocked.  Even for
the two get-the-key levels, the gate quests are still
sub quests since the keys are not used to control the
progression of the source map /per se/, the keys are
used to arbitrate access to the weapon & boss levels.

The exception is the gate quest to the boss map, which
is always used as the end quest of the start map.

The "back" quests are normally used as end quests to the
levels that the gate quests lead to.  The exception here
is the Boss level, because the end quest on boss maps is
the big bloody battle between the player and the bad-ass
dude.


Finally: the gates to the super weapon level and to the
boss level are special since they must require a keyed
door (using a key that might not be given by any quests
on the map).  Hence they are sub quests which force the
door to be keyed (nor do they "extend" their parent).


Example:
--------

start_map
  1. main quest (press moon switch)
     1.1 sub quest (gate -> key A map)
     1.2 sub quest (gate -> weapon map)

  2. end quest (gate to boss map)
     2.1 sub quest (gate -> key B map)

key_A_map
  1. main quest (key A)
     1.1 sub quest (gate -> secret level)
     1.2 sub quest (weapon#2)

  2. end quest (back -> start map)

key_B_map
  1. main quest (press chain switch)
     1.1 sub quest (weapon#3)

  2. local quest (key B)
     2.1 sub quest (item "porkulator")

  3. end quest (back -> start map)

boss_map
  1. main quest (axe key)

  2. end quest (boss "korax")
     2.1 sub quest (back -> start map)
