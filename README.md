# Important note

This is a special .696 release of ObHack for generating the same
maps that my "FreeDoom with ObHack maps" megawad generated (map01
in Doom2 has been updated to always have both a backpack and 
super shotgun).

When the game is Doom2 or FreeDoom, it makes a 96 map megawad; note
that MAP33, MAP34, MAP35, etc. may or may not be supported depending
on which source port one uses.

This is an older, outdated release of ObHack; most people will
want to use the most recent release instead (or, likewise, Oblige 6
or Oblige 7)

## About

ObHack is my name for some modifications Fritz and myself have made
to Oblige, a random map generator for the original Doom, Doom 2, and
Heretic. It is name thusly because it is a hacked Oblige, and as a tribute
to the ObHacks posted to the once-great Usenet newsgroup alt.hackers.

ObHack is a fork of version 2 of Oblige (Oblige 0.81-0.97). It has the
following features that Oblige2 does not have:

* Real secret areas that take work to find
* Improved random number generator which allows arbitrary English or 
  Spanish text to be the seed, resulting in a nearly infinite number of 
  possible seeds
* New modes: Single Player + Deathmatch, Deathmatch without exits, and 
  Capture the Flag
* Progressive level size: Levels get bigger as one gets to higher levels 
  in the wad
* Enclosures and variable room sizes
* Adjustable light level
* Tiny and gigantic level sizes
* Option to have swarms or even more mosters
* Monster traps are back (removed in Oblige 0.94)
* Boss levels now have boss monsters in them
* Choice of player starting weapon
* More texture packs, including contributions from Mr. Chris
* Deathmatch starts in single player maps
* And other features not listed here

## How to compile

These are the files needed to make the Win32 binary of ObHack.  To compile, 
you will need to install both MinGW-3.1.0-1 and MSYS-1.0.10.  Once you do 
that, do something like this:
